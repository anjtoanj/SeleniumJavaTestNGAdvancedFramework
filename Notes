### Why private static final ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver> remoteWebDriver = new ThreadLocal<>(); ###

Analogy
Think of ThreadLocal as a mailbox (the object) and each thread is a different person with their own key.
static final means there is only one mailbox (shared, fixed).
But each person (thread) can put their own letter (value) inside — independent of others.

##Locators.java
Central repository for locator strategies (could be constants, enums, or dynamic locators)
Encourages Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for locators
Easier to update if locators change

##Browser.java
Enum or utility to handle browser types (CHROME, FIREFOX, etc.)
Helps make browser selection dynamic and clean

##Element.java
Abstraction for working with web elements
Might wrap native Selenium actions with better error handling, logging, wait conditions

## protected Actions act; -> SeleniumBase class
Actions is a Selenium class used to simulate complex user interactions, such as:
Mouse hover
Drag and drop
Right-click (context click)
Double-click
Keyboard actions (Ctrl, Shift, etc.)

#Measures to keep test output clean and readable
// Suppress ChromeDriver logs
  ChromeDriverService service = new ChromeDriverService.Builder()
                .withSilent(true) // suppresses logs
                .build();

#Different types of Exceptions
NoSuchElementException-	Thrown when the element could not be found using the given locator.
TimeoutException-	Thrown when a command (like wait) exceeds the configured timeout.
ElementNotInteractableException-	Element is present but not interactable (e.g., hidden or disabled).
StaleElementReferenceException-	Element is no longer attached to the DOM (page refreshed or changed).
WebDriverException-	A generic exception for all WebDriver-related errors (often browser crashes or session loss).
NoSuchWindowException-	Tried to switch to a window that doesn't exist.
NoSuchFrameException-	Tried to switch to a frame that doesn’t exist.
SessionNotCreatedException-	Browser session couldn’t be created (e.g., driver-browser version mismatch).
InvalidSessionIdException-	WebDriver session is not active or has ended.
ElementClickInterceptedException-	Click is intercepted by another element (e.g., popup, overlay).
ElementNotSelectableException	-Tried to select an unselectable element (like an option not in a <select>).
MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException	-Tried to move the mouse to an element outside the viewport.
InvalidSelectorException-	Locator strategy is incorrect (e.g., malformed XPath or CSS).
JavascriptException-	JavaScript execution failed when using JavascriptExecutor.
InvalidElementStateException-	Action performed on an element that's not in the right state (e.g., typing into a read-only field).
Exception Name	Description
WebDriverException	-Generic error — most driver-related or system-level failures fall here.
UnsupportedCommandException-	Command is not supported by the current driver.
UnreachableBrowserException	-WebDriver can’t communicate with the browser (e.g., browser crashed).
