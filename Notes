### Why private static final ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver> remoteWebDriver = new ThreadLocal<>(); ###

Analogy
Think of ThreadLocal as a mailbox (the object) and each thread is a different person with their own key.
static final means there is only one mailbox (shared, fixed).
But each person (thread) can put their own letter (value) inside â€” independent of others.

##Locators.java
Central repository for locator strategies (could be constants, enums, or dynamic locators)
Encourages Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for locators
Easier to update if locators change

##Browser.java
Enum or utility to handle browser types (CHROME, FIREFOX, etc.)
Helps make browser selection dynamic and clean

##Element.java
Abstraction for working with web elements
