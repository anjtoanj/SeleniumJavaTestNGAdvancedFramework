### Why private static final ThreadLocal<RemoteWebDriver> remoteWebDriver = new ThreadLocal<>(); ###

Analogy
Think of ThreadLocal as a mailbox (the object) and each thread is a different person with their own key.
static final means there is only one mailbox (shared, fixed).
But each person (thread) can put their own letter (value) inside â€” independent of others.
